# CECIL RAJENDRA

Cecil Rajendra's novel, No Bed of Roses: The Rose Chan Story, begins with a quote from Rumi.

> The Rose does not care
> If someone calls it a thorn...
> Ordinary eyes classify human beings.
> Pay no attention to what
> so-and-so says about such-and-such.
> Bow only to the essence in a person.

It was such a lovely quote that I had to look it up. The poem is called "Your first eyes" and you can read it here.

You'll notice that Rajendra has taken a few liberties with the poem. He omits the end of the second line, "if someone calls it a thorn, or a jasmine," but he inserted an ellipsis there, so we know something has been omitted.

But his next edit is unforgivable. The fourth line, "Pay no attention to what," does not occur after the third line, "Ordinary eyes categorize human beings," in Rumi's poem. The position of the third line is correct, the position of the fourth line is not.

The fourth line is actually a fragment of a line that occurs earlier in the poem. Here are the original lines (note the line breaks):

> Find those in yourself and pay no attention
> to what so-and-so says about such-and-such.

What has Cecil done? He's chopped off the first half of the first line ("Find those in yourself and...") and moved the line break two words over.

For the last line, "Bow only to the essence in a person," Cecil skips to the fourth verse, where the line is enjambed between the second and third lines.

It's worth mentioning that I'm comparing Rajendra's quote with the Coleman Barks translation of the poem. It could be the case that Rajendra is working with a different translation. Where Bark translates "categorize," Rajendra has "classify." Barks: human being; Rajendra: person. But the number of similarities suggest that this may not be the case. It would help if Rajendra listed any details about the source of this quote, but he doesn't do so.

If Rajendra is working from the Barks translation, then the way he deals with the quote would go a long way towards explaining his approach to poetry.

Cecil Rajendra has a mixed legacy. He is known for founding the legal aid clinic in Georgetown, which is the prototype of the Bar Council's nationwide program of the same name. But he is responsible for some truly awful poetry. He is more of a troubadour than a poet.

Nowadays, he is also known as a diva. He's turned down invitations to read at the Georgetown Literary Festival. In 2012, he rejected an invitation to headline the open mic night because he did not appear on the festival poster. A week later, an anonymous letter complaining about the festval was published in the Star. It is widely believed that Rajendra sent the letter. 

In 2013, he agreed to participate in a talk, but he cancelled his appearance at the last minute. He had come out with No Bed of Roses that year.

What he lacks in quality, he makes up in quantity. He is the most prolific Malaysian poet right now. Rajendra might even style himself an "outlaw poet." His poetry is about social justice, suffering, exclusion, love. These are all worthy themes, but they are not investigated,
