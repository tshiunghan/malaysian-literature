# My Malaysian Literature

I studied literature at university, but I was a poor student. It's true what they say, there's no such thing as bad teachers, just bad students. I would submit my essays at the last second or late or (even worse) not at all. And it wasn't from a lack of trying. I woudl sit in my room for days, working on the same section, paragraph, sentence. Written assignments became stressful and painful events, and I would grow to view an upcoming assignment with suspicion, rather than excitement.
