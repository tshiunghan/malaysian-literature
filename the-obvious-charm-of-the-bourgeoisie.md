The Obvious Charm of The Bourgeoisie

The stale air coming off
the decaying sea-wall
drifts in with the conversation
by the club pool-side.
Across the green baize lawn,
the setting sun transmutes
a pair of kittens among the plates
of the afternoon's garden menu.

The season's awnings reverberate
to the gregarious feeding
of hungry ghosts and a redhaired
eating cili padi.
News comes that the deities
lie blinded in the seventeenth temple
and limousines scatter
to hidden quarters of pleasure.

In the rousing pubs of touts
and punters, a woman traveller
is surrounded with hisses: 
"Sikit gila"; "boleh dapat";
"jangan kacau-lah".
And a jaded pleader procrastinates
contemplating the supreme
realm of the senses.
