# A POET WHO CHAMPIONS THE PEASANTS


## By Shukor Rahman

Kassim Ahmad, the 39-year-old National Chairman of the Parti Sosialis Rakyat Malaya, is also a very human poet; perceptive and compassionate.

Thirty-one of his poems were included in his first anthology entitles "Kemarau Dielembah" (Draught in the Valley) which was published in 1967. Some of the poems, written as far back as 1955, when he was an undergrad in Singapore, are also in the book.

Born in Alor Star, he was in a Malay school before studying at the Sultan Abdul Hamid Secondary School (now SAHC). Hw was awarded an M.A. degree from the University of Malaya in 1961.

Kassim now lives in Bukit Glugor, Penang, with his wife, Fauziah, 32, and their three children.

Kassim edited "Kisah Pelayaran Abdullah" (Oxford University Press) and "Hikayat Hang Tuah" (Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka) which took him a year to complete. He has contributed to local newspapers and magazines.

He reads widely. Among his favourites are Shakespeare, Hemingway, Thomas Mann, Tolstoy, Balzac, Arnold Toynbee, Pasternak and our own Keris Mas and Shahnon Ahmad.


### Reality

He feels that a poet should aim for simplicity, preferring to stand on the solid ground of physical reality rather than float in the clouds of abstraction.

The interweaving of reason and passion goes hand in hand with a strain of insistend argument. This is undeniably the hallmark of Kassim's best poems.

Reason, then, becomes one of the essential elements in the structure of his method, along with the depth of his knowledge and the imaginative distance bridged by his imagery.

"I prefer a simple, terse and direct style. I like the simplicity of Masuri and the beauty of Tongkat, but they both lack conciseness," he says.

"The best of Chairil Anwar, Amir Hamzah and Sitor Sitomurang have all three qualities. I have always aimed for these in my verses, but I have never been fully satisfied with the results."

The three qualities--simplicity, conciseness and beauty--are preserved in "Surat Chinta" (Love Letter) written in 1958.


### Poem

> aku menujukan katakata ku kepadamu
> seorang yang tidak ku kenal, dan kenal
> dengan mata yang tak berbicara
> dengan getaran senyumn
> dari retak jiwa seorang manusia
> bolehkah aku memberanikan diri
> melafazkan sajak insan
> dengan katakata begitu tepat
> yang akan menggesek tall biola hatimu
> aku berdiri terpisah darimu
> oleh sebatang sungai yang deras
> sambil aku berjuang melawan arusnya
> air dan buih yang memercik mungkin menghalang pandanganmu
> dan memikirkan aku tenggelam beralih pergi sebagai perompak hatiku

> I address myself to you
> a stranger too fondly I know
> by the eyes that do not speak
> by the tremor of a smile
> from the cracks of a human soul
> Shall I be brave to utter
> the poem of man
> with an accuracy that will strike
> the nervous string of your heart?
> I stand separated from you
> by a river of no return
> as I battle against its currents
> the splashes and sprays may dim
> your sight and, thinking I am drowned,
> turn away a robber of my heart.

The appeal of Kassim in "Nyanyi" (Song) written on the first day of 1959, as elsewhere, is the direct and arresting manner of the presentation of an apparently simple idea.


### Struggle

> Oleh itu janganlah kau merayu dengan matamu
> hidup ini satu trajidi
> pisaunya mengiris jiwa kita
> selamat tinggal, biariah takdir menentukan.

> do not then plead with those eyes
> life is a tragedy
> the knife of this world cuts through us
> good-bye, let Fate decree.

Kassim champions the downtrodden peasantry and many of his poems depict their life struggles.

"I have lived among them and I have seen their poverty and hardships," he explains.

As a small boy, Kassim moved around in the squalor-ridden areas of Kedah when his father, who was a religious school teacher, was transferred from Bukit Pinang to Bujang and, later, to Bandar Bahru.

The depth of feeling, vividly reflected in his verses, bear testimony to this fact. "Dailog" (Dialogue) is perhaps the most quoted and immediate instance of this quality.


### Controversy

> ada besok maka pasti ada suria
> aku akan pergi
> dengan seribu Jebat si anak tani
> kian lama kita mati dalam setia
> kali ini kita hidup dalam durhaka!

> Tomorrow will come, so there will be brightness
> I will go
> with a thousand Jebat sons of the peasantry,
> so long have we died in submission
> now we will live in revolution.

One of his most controversial poems, which reflects the intensity of his poetry is "Sidang Ruh" (Assembly of Souls) written in 1960.

> nanti akan padamalab dengan sendirinya
> lampu dari menara tinggi
> kerana dibawahnya orang kian mabuk
> dan Tuhan sudah mati.

Kassim explains that the controversy arose because some religious conservatives misinterpreted the poem as anti-God.

"This is not true. The last line in the poem is meant to convey to the readers that man no longer heeds and obeys God's commands. It is a pessimistic poem," he asserts.

"Surat Dari Dewidewi" (Letter of the Muses) written in 1958, champions the cause of the working class.

> mari turunlah sekarang
> dari kedinginan sekarang
> kepadang luas panas dibawah. Lihatlah, dan
> bukan untuk kita dongeng dewadewa mati
> tetapi untuk mengangikan lagu para pekerja
> dalam orkes yang maha hebat
> dari ciptaan hidup yang paling akhir.


### Hibernating

At the end of 1962, Kassim was offered the post of a lecturer in Malay language and literature at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London. He accepted and worked there for three years.

Since 1962, he has stopped writing. During this ten year 'hibernation' he has only written political speeches, reports and articles for the party organ.

"Political life robs me of the time and quiet that I need for writing. But I feel keenly that I want to write again.

"In a sense, I dislike politics for its devious ways, but then, how can one love the people and yet hate politics?" he asks.
