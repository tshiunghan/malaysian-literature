# China's door is open to novelist Samad


## By Tan Gim Ean

Picture a Chinese actress in the title role of Salina, the live-for-love prostitute in A. Samad Said's maiden novel.

Next, visualise a slum from either Beijing or Shanxi Province in China passing off as Kampung Kambing in Singapore, the squalid setting for the book.

Far-fetched? No, not if the plan by Shanxi Literature Publishers to turn Salina into a feature film comes through.

In 1985, Li Wen-Zhong did a Chinese translation of Salina for Shanxi. It was the first Malaysian novel to be translated into Chinese in China, and its initial print run of 15,000 copies has been sold out. The second print run is under way and it seems a bookstore in Kuala Lumpur intends to import copies for sale here.

Late last month, Shanxi chairman Luo Zi Chang, met with Samad in KL and broached the prospect of filming Salina. The author is keen, but details have yet to be worked out.

First, Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka (DBP), which owns the copyright to Salina, has to give the green light. Secondly, questions like where the film will be shot, who will be in the cast and what language to use, have to be answered.

DBP officials say that since DBP has no experience in film-making, shooting will probably be done in China based on a script written there. Chinese actors and actresses will be used and the dialogue will be in Chinese, with Malay, and perhaps English, subtitles done by the Malaysian side.

Given the universal themes of Salina--poverty, hatred, and lost innocence--it's safe to say Chinese filmgoers would have no problems identifying with its Malay characters.

The novel, hailed as a watershed work of modern Malay fiction, was written in 1958. It took Samad less than two months to complete it. Then 23, he wrote as if possessed, scribbling into the wee hours of the night, then putting in another three hours each day before going to work as a clerk in a Singapore hospital.

It won him a consolation prize in a competition organised by DBP that same year. The novel was published in 1961 and since then, it has been translated into French, Japanese, Russian, Tamil, and English. The last was done in 1976 by Harry Aveling, the Australian translator and literary scholar.

The novel is set in post-war Singapore and centres around a group of destitute people. Among them are Salina, the prostitute who is resigned to having ex-seaman Abdul Fakar live off her immoral earnings; cynical divorcee Zarina, who secretly longs for a secure married life; her innocent daughter Nahidah, whose hopes for happiness are crushed even before she reaches puberty; and schoolboy Hilmi, whom she loves.

Writer-director Johan Jaafar adapted Salina into a play and directed the production staged at the Second Kuala Lumpur Arts Festival in 1986.

Now that Salina has opened the door to China for Samad, the Chinese publishers are eager for him to go further. During his informal visit to KL, Luo Xi Chang proposed translating another Samad Said novel and even invited him to visit China.

The author suggested Sungai Mengalir Lesu, which has been translated into English (Lazy River, 1981) by Aveling. This, however, is also subject to approval by DBP. If that comes through, Li Wen-Zhong will again undertake the translation.

Meanwhile, Samad is planning to visit Thailand and India, so a trip to China is not likely this year. He feels 1992 would be a better time as it would enable him to read up about the country and its people, besides giving the publisher time to translate Sungai Mengalir Lesu and have his trip coincide with the book launch.

If Salina makes it to the screen, it will be the second time a novel of his has been adapted to the medium. In 1981, his Langit Petang was made into a movie by Syed Kechik Film Productions, directed by Shahrom Muhamad Dom.

Two years ago, Johan Jaafar adapted the same novel for a TV drama to be undertaken by Syarikat Elstree. He completed six episodes, then stopped work because of some problems between Samad and Elstree.

But recently, both Samad and Johan have discovered that the script has been "sold" to another company and filming is under way without their knowledge or consent.

An angry Samad has threatened court action. "We don't want to be treated as non-entities. They should have referred to either Johan or myself first," he asserts.

"As things are, it's as if they had picked up the script from a rubbish dump by the drain, or that we've been dead since Munshi Abdullah's time."
