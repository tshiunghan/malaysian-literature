# Welcome!

I'm trying out Github for a writing project. Let's see how it goes!

## MALAYSIAN LITERATURE

I have wanted to write about Malaysian Literature for a long time. The problem is, I can't seperate my feelings from my analysis. I want everything to be perfect. But the truth is, this is just an excuse to postpone this thing that I want to do.

It'll never be perfect. That's why I'm starting now.

## ARCHIVE

Kee Thuan Chye loaned me a bunch of his newspapers with the understanding that I would somehow archive his work in literary journalism. I have done very little work on this. I hope I can do more now. I of course own none of this material. And I make it freely available so that there is a public record of past literary discussions that have taken place in this country.

## LITERATURE IN GENERAL

How can I sort out my feelings for Malaysian literature if I don't know how I feel about literature with a capital L? There will be some thinking about that going on in here.

Perhaps there will be some looking at other countries' literatures. I am particularly interested in the Caribbean, Irish, African literature. I think they all have something to say to us.
