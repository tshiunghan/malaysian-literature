# A TAXONOMY OF MALAYSIAN LITERATURE

Malaysian literature falls into a few broad categories.

  * Literature about Malaysia by a non-Malaysian (Anthony Burgess's As the Day Wanes)
  * Literature about Malaysia by a Malaysian (Tash Aw's The Harmony Silk Factory)
  * Literature about somewhere else by a Malaysian (Tash Aw's A Map of the Invisible World)

As you can see, the nationality of the writer is important. But apart from having a Malaysian passport, what does it mean to be Malaysian? Perhaps it means you have to have lived in Malaysia. Or you consider Malaysia your home.

Additionally, if a writer is born Chinese, there is an expectation that the writer writes about Chinese experiences. The same goes for Malay writers and Malay experiences. The same goes for Indian writers.

I'm not sure where this expectation comes from.

Does being Malaysian mean being a Malaysian citizen? Do I have to have a Malaysian passport or can I be just a permanent resident? Is it enough to feel Malaysian? Can someone claim the label of Malaysian? Or must it be bestowed? Is there a criteria?

The Malaysian-ness of the author determines if the work is considered Malaysian. Can an author be Malaysian and not know it?

Also important is the sense of place in the literary work. There is no question that place is intertwined with identity. Obviously, what is in Malaysia is Malaysian.

I think there is no dispute that Anthony Burgess's Malaysian Trilogy is Malaysian literature. As well as the Sejarah Melayu. The works of the national laureates are Malaysian, right? One does not need to win an award to enter the Malaysian literary canon. What about the works of Wong Phui Nam, who has never won an award?

Alternatively, we can approach the question from the other way: what is not Malaysian?

Shakespeare is not Malaysian, his stories take place in a far away land centuries ago. But it is often said that Shakespeare reminds us of our sapience, what it means to be human. And although we are talking about a Western concept of humanness, what is a Malaysian, if not also a human? In other words, do we bring something new to what it means to be human, like an Asian Declaration of Human Rights? Being Malaysian is not the same as being English, although there is a commonality between the two.

Call it Asian Exceptionalism: this idea that Westerners will never understand what it means to be Asian, because what it means is ultimately unspeakable, it has to be experienced. And we respect the white men and women who assimilate into our culture (I say our culture, as if I belonged), but that assimilation comes at a price. As ... has shown, it is hard to co-exist in two separate but distinct cultures. In fact, that co-existence is a culture unto itself.

We might try to narrow down the definition of Malaysian literature to "literature that says something about Malaysia."
