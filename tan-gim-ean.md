# TAN GIM EAN

Many of the literary pieces in the NST are written by a writer named Tan Gim Ean. I wonder what she's doing now.

According to this (2012 article)[http://www.thestar.com.my/story.aspx?sec=north&file=%2f2012%2f10%2f1%2fNorth%2f12104028]

Tan is an editor for Star Two, the lifestyle section for The Star Daily. The article also mentions that Tan is 56 and from Penang. It also says that she is based in Menara Star in PJ.
