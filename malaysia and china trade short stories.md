# Malaysia and China trade short stories

## By Tan Gim Ean

Local Malay writers are being read in China. If that surprises you, here's more. Soon, we will be getting works by Chinese authors from that country.

Translations of literary writingâ€”-from Bahasa Malaysia into Chinese and vice versa--are part of a two-way exchange between Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka (DBP) and publishers in China.

The exchange was sealed during a visit by eight members from DBP to China in December 1989. A memorandum signed then gave Shanxi Literature Publishers the contract to publish 24 Malaysian short stories which had been translated into Chinese.

The result is "Mawar Merah Di Jambanggan", which was published in January this year. The book takes its title from a story by Khadijah Hashim, one of the 21 writers whose works are featured.

A second memorandum, signed during the Chinese publishers' reciprocal visit to Malaysia last October, allows Modern Press Beijing to print 20 short stories by Malaysian women writers, which will be translated into Chinese by DBP.

The writers are Adibah Amin, Anis Sabirin, Salmi Manja, Zawiah Mohd Noh, Zaharah Nawawi, Khadijah Hashim, Rokiah Abu Bakar, Timah Baba, Anis, Salmah Mohsin, Sarah Rahim, Fatimah Busu, Rogayah A. Hamid, Zurinah Hassan, Siti Zainon Ismail, Zanariah Wan Abdul Rahman, Syafikah Affandi, Zaharah Ibrahim, Siti Aisah Murad, and Azmah Nordin.

In return, DBP will translate (into Malay) and publish 20 stories by Chinese women writers.

Cross-cultural projects like these are handled by DBP's Jawatankuasa Penulis-Penulis Berbagai Kaum, which then farms out the actual translation work to the Persatuan Penjemahan dan Penulisan Kreatif Malaysia (Perspektif).

Goh Hin San, who is the secretary for both groups, says translating is one of their most active programmes. And this activity literally thrives on home ground.

For example, the contents of "Mawar Merah Di Jambangan" were shortlisted from hundreds of short stories translated from Malay and published in seven local Chinese newspapers between 1988 and 1990 under a project called Titian Sastera.

Those whose works were picked are Keris Mas (two stories), Shahnon Ahmad (two), Arenawati (two), Usman Awang, A. Samad Said, Kemala, Anwar Ridhwan, Anis, Azizi Haji Abdullah, S. Othman Kelantan, Hassan Ali, Fatimah Busu, Baharuddin Kahar, Ali Majod, Awang Ku Marali, Razak Mamat, Zurinah Hassan, Mana Sikana, Ajikik, Jong Chian Lai, and Khadijah Hashim.

A group of eight officials from DBP will be visiting China again in May, in conjunction with the official launch of "Mawar Merah". It is the first collection of Malaysian short stories to be sold in China.

Another project under the Jawatankuasa is "Angkatan Ini", a translation of 16 Chinese short stories (by local writers) into Malay. The book was published in 1988 and its second print is reportedly selling well.

As a follow-up to "Angkatan Ini", DBP is working on a second book featuring 16 Chinese short stories published in Watan from 1989 to 1990. The compilation is being edited by Othman Putih of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia and it is expected to see print this year.

Plans for a third book of translated short stories is under discussion. This time, DBP hopes to work with a local newspaper. Again, the 16 Chinese short stories will be published monthly in the paper.

Mr Goh stressed that by the time Jawatankuasa comes out with its third book, 48 local Chinese writers would have had their works translated into Malay.

"We get our material from the Chinese Writers' Association, which has over 200 members. More of the writers are coming forward," he said.

Feedback on the translations has been very encouraging, he adds. What strikes him most is that the Chinese writings have struck a chord in Malay readers.

"I have Malays coming up to tell me, 'Chinese thinking is the same as ours.' As the saying goes, tak kenal tak cinta."

Mr Goh recalls that the formation of the Jawatankuasa Penulis-Penulis Berbagai Kaum Malaysia was initiated by poet Usman Awang, On May 31, 1983, the latter organised a gathering at DBP and the committee was formed there.

It comprises four sections--Malay, Chinese, English, Tamil--and each has three members. Ayob Yamin of DBP is the present chairman, after Usman Awang and Anwar Ridhwan.

In 1984, the committee held its first public function--Malam Bunga Rampai--during which guest artistes read their own works, followed by translated versions.
